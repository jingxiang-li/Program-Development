<h3>Lab Session 5: Debugging with the GNU Debugger GDB</h3>

<p><strong>Lab 5 due date:</strong> none, simply turn in work
  completed during lab.</p>
<hr/>


<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
<ol>
 <li><p>This lab is to be done with your project partner.  If your
 partner is not present then ask your TA how to proceed.</p>

 <li><p>Get the latest additions to the class repository down to your
  account.  In the <code>labs/lab_05</code> directory will be some
  files that you need for this lab. </p>

  <p>Create a directory named <code>labs/lab_05</code> at the top
  level of your <b>group</b> repository and copy the lab 5 files from
  the class repository there.</p>

  <p>Use Git to 'add', 'commit' and 'push' the 'labs' directory.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

 
<h3>Using GDB</h3>

<p>Use <code>gdb</code> to find
  the locations of segmentation faults in the
  program <code>buggy.cpp</code>.</p>

<p>At the end of the lab session, commit and push your work to the
  central github repository.  You <b>do not</b> need to find all the bugs to
  receive full credit for this lab.</p>

<p>However, you cannot leave early until you've shown the TA that
 your <code>buggy</code> program runs without segmentation
 faults.</p>

<p>
There is one bug in the code that can't be found by <code>gdb</code> because it doesn't cause a segfault. You'll need to use the <code>valgrind</code> memory mismanagement detector. You can find a tutorial on <code>valgrind</code>
    <a href="http://cs.ecs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/tools/valgrind/"> here </a>
    </p>

<p>In this debugging process, make sure <b>you and your partner both
 run <code>gdb</code> at least once</b> in this process.  All the work
 can be done in the workspace of a single person, however.</p>

<h4>Useful gdb commands:</h4>

The following is a basic set of commands to get your started. The <b>highlighted</b> commands are the most useful for getting started.

<h4>GDB References</h4>

There are many places to find additional documentation on <code>gdb</code>:
<ul>
<li>Command reference: <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/GDB-Commands.html">here</a></li>
<li>Another tutorial: <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gilpin/tutorial/">here</a></li>
<li>Search for "gdb tutorial" on the web.</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<h3>Using gdb on your own programs</h3>

<ol>
  <li><p>Make sure that the debugging symbols are being generated when
  you compile your programs. To do this edit the Makefile. For all
  lines calling <b>g++</b> add the flag <b>-g</b>. (i.e. <b>g++ -g -o
  ...</b>)</p></li>
  <li><p>Then do a <b>make clean</b> and recompile. Then you can run
  gdb on your executable.</p></li> 
</ol>


<hr>
<h3>What to turn in.</h3>

<p>If you've found all of the bugs before the end of the lab session ask
the TA to  verify that you've completed the work.  Then commit/push
your work using Git so that it is available on the central github
repository.</p>

<p>If you've not finished finding all of the bugs by the end of lab,
  turn in your work anyway.  You do not need to have found all of the
  bugs to get full credit for this lab. </p>
