For the AST.cpp file, we both divided the work equally. Tanoja finished implementing classes for Stmt, Stmts, Program, Decl and Jingxiang finished implementing classes and subclasses for Node and Expr.
For the parser.cpp file, Jinxiang wrote functions for parseProgram, parseStandardDecl, and all parseExpr.
The rest of the functions in this file were written by Tanoja.
We both worked together to debug the errors in the AST.h, AST.cpp, and parser.cpp files.
We both divided the work equally for Writing Assignment 2, Developing the UML Deisgn.
We split worked on parts of the UML diagram separaelty and then combined our diagrams together in the Draw.io online application and turned it in as a pdf file on github in our team repository.
